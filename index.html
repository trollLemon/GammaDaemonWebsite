            <p>GammaDaemon can operate within any Linux environment and is independent of init services. You can initiate it from various sources, such as an autorun script or an <code>exec</code> statement in a Window Manager config file.</p>

        <section>
            <p>GammaDaemon allows you to fine-tune screen brightness levels, ranging from 0 to 255, which can be customized to your preference. The configuration file is located at <code>$HOME/.config/GammaDaemon/conf.toml</code>. In the event that GammaDaemon is unable to locate this configuration file, it will default to using a built-in configuration.</p>
